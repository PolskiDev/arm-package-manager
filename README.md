# ARM Package Manager
A portable UNIX package manager developed mainly for RPM distros (Fedora) with internal similarities and facilities to DEB packages (Ubuntu, Debian),
however all linux distros are supported (like: snapd) by doing the installation with the Makefile      [ **_make_** ]      and to update ARM Package Manager use:


**_make remove_**  
**_make_**  
  
    
Tested on: Fedora Linux 35 - Arch: x86_64 (amd64)
